"""The pre-action briefing: verdicts, scoping, and what it refuses to imply.

These tests are written against the properties an agent depends on, not the
current wording. A briefing is a control on real work, so the things worth
pinning are: the same intent gives the same verdict, a record never appears
twice, an unnamed service never borrows another team's history, and an empty
memory says "empty" rather than "fine".
