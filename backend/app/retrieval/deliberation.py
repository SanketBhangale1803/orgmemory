"""Answer a question several independent ways, then judge which one fits.

A single synthesis pass optimizes for the question's wording. The same evidence
often supports a better answer at a different altitude: the asker who types "why
is checkout failing" may want the cause, the fix, or the honest list of what the
evidence does not establish. Rather than guess once, this module runs the
grounded synthesis under several lenses in parallel and then asks a judge which
candidate actually answers what was asked.

Every candidate is produced under the same evidence contract as the single-pass
path, so judging can only pick between grounded answers — it can never introduce
an ungrounded one. When no model is configured, when the feature is disabled, or
when the judge call fails, this degrades to exactly the previous behaviour.
