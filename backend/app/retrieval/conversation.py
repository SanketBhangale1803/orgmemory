"""Answers that are correct without company evidence.

The retrieval stack is evidence-first by design: if the graph holds nothing, it
withholds. That is right for "why is checkout failing" and wrong for "hello" or
"what is a race condition" — refusing those makes the product feel broken rather
than careful. This module handles the two cases where withholding is the wrong
answer, and nothing else:

* **assistant** — greetings, thanks, and questions about OrgMemory itself. Answered
  deterministically so they work with no model key configured.
* **general knowledge** — questions that are not about this company at all, used
  only after company retrieval has already come back empty.

Company questions never reach here while evidence exists, so the evidence
contract in :mod:`app.retrieval.reasoner` is unaffected.
