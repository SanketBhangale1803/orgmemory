"""Package an answer as a task an editor agent can start from.

When someone asks OrgMemory to fix, patch, or review something, the useful
output is not prose — it is a scoped instruction plus the minimum context needed
to act, in a form that can be pasted into Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, or sent
through MCP. Handing over the entire evidence pack defeats the point: the value
is deciding which few sources actually matter for the requested change.

Built deterministically from evidence already selected for the answer, so it
never costs an extra model call and never introduces an unsourced claim.
