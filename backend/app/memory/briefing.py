"""Pre-action briefings: what this company knows before an agent changes anything.

Every other retrieval surface in OrgMemory answers a *question*. This one answers
an *intent* — "I am about to do X to service Y" — which is a different shape of
request and needs a different shape of answer. A question wants the best passage;
an intent wants the constraints it is about to violate.

Three properties make this trustworthy enough to gate real work on:

* **Deterministic.** No model runs here. A briefing that changes its verdict
  between two identical calls is not a control, and an agent about to restart a
  production pool needs a control. Everything returned is a stored memory with an
  id a person can open.
* **Recall over precision.** Missing a prior incident is far more expensive than
  showing one extra. The kind-scoped pulls deliberately return the service's
  history even when the task text does not overlap with it.
* **Never silently empty.** When memory holds nothing, the verdict says so
  explicitly rather than returning a confident-looking empty brief, because
  "nothing found" and "nothing to worry about" are opposite instructions.
