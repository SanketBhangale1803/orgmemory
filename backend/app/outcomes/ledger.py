"""Record the triple: context served → action taken → outcome observed.

Every competitor can ingest the same Slack and GitHub. What none of them holds is
the record of *which context actually produced correct action inside this
company*. That record is only obtainable by instrumenting the loop while it runs,
it compounds per-customer, and it is what a judge or reranker can later be
fine-tuned on. So the ledger is written from day one, before anything consumes it.

Three rules shape this module:

* **Never break an answer.** Instrumentation is secondary to the product. Every
  write is best-effort; a failure here degrades the corpus, never the response.
* **Link, don't duplicate.** A context row stores what a training example needs
  (the question, the answer, the candidates, the evidence ids) and points at the
  envelope for the rest.
* **Outcomes are a closed vocabulary, actions are open.** Reward depends on the
  outcome, so it must be comparable across rows; the set of things a person or
  agent might *do* with an answer is not knowable in advance.
