"""Apply a handoff to real code with a headless coding agent, then commit it.

This is the step that turns OrgMemory from something that *explains* into
something that *acts*. A handoff already contains the task and exactly the
context needed to do it; this module hands that to `cursor-agent` or `claude`
running non-interactively in a throwaway clone, captures what changed, and
commits it on a branch.

The safety model is deliberately blunt, because the failure mode of an
autonomous code editor is destroying work:

* **Never the user's checkout.** Every run clones into its own directory under
  `settings.execution_dir`. The ingest cache is read to build memory and is
  never handed to an agent.
* **Never the default branch.** A run always creates `orgmemory/<slug>` and
  commits there, so nothing lands on main by accident.
* **Committing is local; pushing is not.** A local commit on a throwaway clone
  is free to discard. Publishing to a shared remote is visible to other people,
  so it needs `allow_push` to be turned on explicitly.
* **No changes is a real outcome, not an error.** An agent that decides nothing
  needs doing is reported as `no_changes`, never as a fabricated success.

Every run also writes itself into the outcome ledger. That is the point: a
commit that survives is the strongest signal that the retrieved context was
right, and it is recorded without anyone clicking anything.
