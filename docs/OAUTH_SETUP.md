# OAuth provider setup

OrgMemory never asks a user to paste a GitHub personal access token or Slack bot
token into the browser. OAuth integrations use provider-hosted authorization code
flows, server-side code exchange, single-use state, and encrypted workspace storage.

Application sign-in is separate from source connection:

- Google and GitHub identify the person opening OrgMemory.
- Passwordless email uses a six-digit, ten-minute, one-time code.
- Connecting GitHub or Slack later grants source access to the active workspace.

## GitHub

Create one GitHub OAuth App under **Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps**.

| Field | Local value | Production value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application name | `OrgMemory Local` | Your public OrgMemory product name |
| Homepage URL | `http://localhost:3000` | `https://app.your-domain.com` |
| Authorization callback URL | `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/github/callback` | `https://api.your-domain.com/api/auth/github/callback` |

Copy the client ID and generate a client secret, then set the server-only values:

```dotenv
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/auth/github/callback
```

Restart OrgMemory. **Continue with GitHub** requests only `read:user user:email`.
The separate **Connect GitHub** action requests `repo read:org`, which is needed
by a GitHub OAuth App to discover and clone private repositories. GitHub OAuth
does not offer read-only source-code scope; the production roadmap should migrate
this connector can migrate to a GitHub App for repository-level selection and short-lived,
fine-grained installation tokens.

For an organization using SAML SSO or third-party application restrictions, an
organization owner may also need to approve or authorize the OAuth App.

If the login screen says GitHub is unavailable, inspect the readiness endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/providers
```

The response names the missing environment variables without exposing any secret.

## Google

Create an OAuth 2.0 **Web application** in Google Cloud, configure its consent
screen, and add these authorized redirect URIs:

| Environment | Redirect URI |
| --- | --- |
| Local | `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/google/callback` |
| Production | `https://api.your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback` |

Then set:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/auth/google/callback
```

Google sign-in requests `openid email profile`, uses PKCE, consumes OAuth state
once, creates the user/workspace session server-side, and stores no Google access
token because identity login does not need one after the profile is read.

## Passwordless email

Development mode returns the code only in the `/api/auth/email/request` response
so local sign-in works without a mail service. Production refuses to enable email
delivery unless SMTP is configured:

```dotenv
EMAIL_AUTH_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_CODE_TTL_MINUTES=10
EMAIL_CODE_RESEND_SECONDS=45
EMAIL_FROM=memory@company.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.company.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=...
SMTP_PASSWORD=...
SMTP_STARTTLS=true
```

Only an HMAC of the code is stored. A newer code invalidates older codes, codes
expire after the configured TTL, and a verified code cannot be reused.

## Slack

Create a Slack app **From an app manifest** and use this local manifest:

```yaml
display_information:
  name: OrgMemory Local
oauth_config:
  redirect_urls:
    - http://localhost:8000/api/auth/slack/callback
  scopes:
    user:
      - channels:read
      - channels:history
      - groups:read
      - groups:history
      - chat:write
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Copy the client ID and client secret from **Basic Information**, then set:

```dotenv
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=...
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/auth/slack/callback
```

Restart OrgMemory and select **Connect Slack**. The connecting user chooses the
workspace on Slack. OrgMemory stores the returned user-scoped token and can list
the public and private conversations that person is allowed to access. It does
not gain access to channels the person cannot see.

For production, replace both redirect URLs with HTTPS URLs before issuing any
credentials, set `AUTH_DEV_MODE=false`, set a non-default `JWT_SECRET`, and
provide a stable KMS-managed `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
